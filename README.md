# Giving-First-Charter
A small, open protocol for practicing generosity, dignity, and mutual care.
 
It offers a simple framework for how individuals, groups, and communities can show up for one another without extraction, ego, or expectation.

This repository contains the canonical text of the Charter.  
Forks and adaptations are welcome, provided the original intent of giving‑first stewardship is honored.

## Purpose
The Charter exists as a reference point — a quiet standard for cooperative practice.  
It is not a brand, organization, or campaign. It is simply a tool that anyone may use.

## Structure
- `charter.md` — the full text of the Giving‑First Charter  
- `LICENSE` — terms for reuse (to be added)  
- `mirrors.md` — optional list of identical copies hosted elsewhere  

## How to Use
You may:
- read it  
- share it  
- cite it  
- fork it  
- adapt it for your own community or context  

If you create a fork or derivative, consider linking back to this repository so others can trace the lineage.

## Stewardship
This repository is maintained under the name **Albert Ienstein**, a neutral vessel chosen so the Charter may travel freely without attachment to biography or identity.
